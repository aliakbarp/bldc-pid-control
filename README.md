##AVR Programming using avr-gcc
This directory is for saving my final project code and learning make a avr microcontroller program using avr-gcc. Every folder contains **README** for code explanation, and a **Makefile** for compiling code. In **Makefile** I use ATMega328, 16MHz clock frequency, and USBTiny programmer.

##Building program with Makefile
Compiling program
`sudo make`

Upload a HEX file to board
`sudo make program`

Cleaning compiled file
`sudo make clean`
